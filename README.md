Tricky Triangle
======

## overview

Program to solve the tricky triangle problem (of arbitrary size and starting position)!
	(for those who are not familiar, a picture of the game is below, and instructions can be found [here](http://ourpastimes.com/instructions-tricky-triangle-8329167.html)
	)

Program calculates and iterates through all possible move at given game state making move, then recursing into new game state, repeating this process until either a given game state does not have any possible moves which can be made or a winning game state is found. In both of these base case the program ends at that recursion level and the program continues.
