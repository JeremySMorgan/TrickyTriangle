Tricky Triangle
======

## overview

Program to solve the tricky triangle problem (of arbitrary size and starting position)!
	(for those who are not familiar, a picture of the game is below, and instructions can be found [here](http://ourpastimes.com/instructions-tricky-triangle-8329167.html)
	)

The program starts by calculating and iterating through all possible moves at the initial GameState. During each iteration, the move is made and the new game state is fed into the recursive function. This process is repeated until either a given game state does not have any possible moves which can be made or a winning game state is found. In both of these base cases the program ends at that recursion level and the program continues at a the level higher.
